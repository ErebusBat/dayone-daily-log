daily-log
=========

Short ruby script to append snippets to a [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) entry.

The idea is that you have one entry per day, tagged with `dailylog`, that has short snippets of text with a corresponding time.

This script will append these entries for you or create the initial daily entry if needed.

Assumptions
===========
 - You use Sublime Text as your editor
 - You use homebrewed ZSH as your shell
 - You use DropBox sync for DayOne
